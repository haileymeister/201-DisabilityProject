"1 A margin of error is a measure of an estimate's variability.  The larger the margin of error in relation to the size of the estimate, the less reliable the estimate.  The margins of error shown in this table are for the 90 percent confidence level.  For more information about the source and accuracy of the estimates, including margins of error, standard errors and confidence intervals, see the Source and Accuracy Statement at <http://www.census.gov/sipp/sourceac/S&A08_W1toW6(S&A-13).pdf>.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
An '*****' in the margin of error column indicates that the estimate is controlled to independent population estimates.  A statistical test for sampling variability is not appropriate. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
