# Final Project Brainstorm
Disability and access in the United States

## Domain of Interest
We want to look at **disability across the United States**, the different types and their prevalence by state. We want to understand where there may be deficits in physical accessibility and possibly see what kind of accessibility is needed in certain areas. Two of our group members are in a disability studies class at the moment and would like to learn more about the needs of this community through the lens of data.

## Examples of data driven projects
- The [US Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/library/visualizations/2016/comm/cb16-ff12_disabilities.html) produced this visualization on the prevalence of disabilities for ages 18+. It details the amount of people suffering from disabilities in the categories of ambulatory, independent living, cognitive, hearing, self-care, and vision in ages 18-65 vs ages 65+.
- The [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/disabilityandhealth/infographic-disability-impacts-all.html) produced infographics detailing the percentage of adults in the US living with functional disabilities, and proportions of people without healthcare.
- A data website [Knoema](https://knoema.com/quiisf/physically-challenged-population-across-united-states) created visualizations based on physical disabilities by state and type in the US. The amount of people with disabilities in each state were estimated and the states were ranked by the disability estimates in various infographics.

### Data driven questions
- How many people in the US claim to have a disability? <br/> This can be answered with data by comparing total summaries of people registered with a disability.
- What US states are the most physically accessible?
<br/> This can be answered with data by comparing public transportation ADA compliance means by state.
- Which state has the highest concentration of people with disabilities?
<br/> This can be answered with data by comparing proportions of state registered disabilities with the whole population.

## Finding data
#### Dataset 1
- **Where did you download the data (e.g., a web URL)?** <br/>
[Dataset 1](https://www.kaggle.com/city-of-seattle/sea-aging-and-disability-services-client-level)
- **How was the data collected or generated? Make sure to explain who collected the data (not necessarily the same people that host the data), and who or what the data is about?** <br/>
The Seattle City’s Aging and Disability Services collected the data by tracking services to clients. The data is about older individuals and those who live with disabilities. The data details the individual’s family and financial status, ability to perform actions, and basic individual background.  
- **How many observations (rows) are in your data?** <br/>
100 observations
- **How many features (columns) are in the data?** <br/>
45 features
- **What questions (from above) can be answered using the data in this dataset?** <br/>
We can answer the living conditions of older individuals living with disabilities in the city of Seattle. We can compare the accessibility of Seattle to other states in the US.

#### Dataset 2
- **Where did you download the data (e.g., a web URL)?** <br/>
[Dataset 2](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/ssa-disability-claim-data/resource/11058e2b-2d30-4d2b-998a-9dfaa6aa693f)
- **How was the data collected or generated? Make sure to explain who collected the data (not necessarily the same people that host the data), and who or what the data is about?** <br/>
The US Government Social Security Administration collected the data based on fiscal year claims of SSA benefits for disabilities.
- **How many observations (rows) are in your data?** <br/>
780 observations (not including column names)
- **How many features (columns) are in the data?** <br/>
30 features
- **What questions (from above) can be answered using the data in this dataset?** <br/>
This could answer how many people claim to have disabilities by state in the US. We can also use this data to determine which states have the highest populations of people who qualify and receive disability benefits.

#### Dataset 3
- **Where did you download the data (e.g., a web URL)?** <br/>
[Dataset 3](https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2012/demo/p70-131.html)
- **How was the data collected or generated? Make sure to explain who collected the data (not necessarily the same people that host the data), and who or what the data is about?** <br/>
From the census bureau. The information was collected through surveys and supplemental questionnaires.  
- **How many observations (rows) are in your data?** <br/>
42 observations
- **How many features (columns) are in the data?** <br/>
15 features
- **What questions (from above) can be answered using the data in this dataset?** <br/>
This can tell us what age and sex claim to have disability across the United States.
